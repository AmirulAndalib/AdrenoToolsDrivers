# AdrenoTools Drivers
A repository for all the drivers for <a href="https://github.com/skyline-emu/skyline">Skyline</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K-Android">Vita3K</a>. 
<br>Qualcomm drivers are extracted from qualcomm-soc-using devices, like Smartphones or the Oculus Quest.
<br>Turnip drivers are compiled from <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/index.html">Mesa</a>.

To use them, just place them anywhere on your device. Skyline's driver configuration in the Settings screen will request to point towards the drivers via 
the device's internal file manager.

For TWRP or Magisk modules, join the Adreno <a href="https://t.me/adreno_konabess">Konabess Support Telegram group</a>.
